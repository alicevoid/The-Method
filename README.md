### Developed & Maintained by alicevoid. Make sure to be Nice to Yourself `<3`

**Last Updated:** November 24, 2025

## Overview

This site allows you to randomly search for youtube videos in specific formats. These formats often result in videos uploaded en-masse from automated systems- which allows you to see a lot of random stuff you'd have a tough time finding otherwise. 

## How To: 
1. Open the site @: https://recyclebin.pvc.dog
2. Click the "Find Video!" button 
3. Adjust the settings if you'd like

    ### Settings, Explained: 
    - Filter for specific Genres and Terms 
    - Use a Custom Date for search results
    - Create and Export Custom Terms

## Why I Made This 

Mostly? I was bored. 

At this point I'm just adding featurebloat to see how far I can push it.  

## Where I Found the Terms 

So this whole this is mostly inspired by youtube channel KVNAUST's series on Random Youtube Videos. When I saw they had a list of "Methods" to find obscure youtube videos with zero views, I felt like it'd be fun to recreate the list as a site that let you easily find search results. A lot of this site is heavily inspired by their work- from the layout to the site to the search terms i initially started working with. 

Therefore, I just wanna take a second and say: **if you like this site, check out their channel @ https://www.youtube.com/KVNAUST.**
